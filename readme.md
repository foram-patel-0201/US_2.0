Always High is a College help app cattered towards helping the college students in managing their day-to-day hassle!

## Problem :

In the online mode of education, the students are confused by working on many different platforms. The main problem in using all
these different platforms is that they have to check many places from time to time for quizzes, assignment submissions,
timetable changes and much more. 

## Solution :

We have developed an app that can be used to solve the problem described above and on top of that it has many more features which
will ease out the learning experience of the students in online mode.

To solve the problem, our app has a Notification Board that notifies the students about the upcoming quizzes and
assignments that are pending. The app also reminds you of the ongoing class and also provide you with the meet link of the same. 

Sometimes the faculty may postpone or prepone the class and for that, we have given them edit access to the timetable. If any
changes are made to the timetable all the students in the following batch will get informed via a notification in the app.


## Features : 

One of the coolest features of this app is that it has Password-less login, which means that you are not required to enter
the password every time you open the app. At first, you just need to log in for the first time with an OTP and in the 
future, the app will log you in with your biometric lock.

## Future Developnents :

1. Resources for the preparation will be added which includes notes, useful videos, important web pages, previous year
papers and much more.
2. Assignment submission will be added on this app itself.
3. Notifications for Extra/Fun activities {All events-Non academic} (club events,scheduled occasion celebrations, birthdays)
